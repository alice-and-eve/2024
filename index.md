Welcome to our free one-day workshop for celebrating women studying and working in computing!
Alice & Eve aims to bring together talents in the field of computing. The fourth edition of this workshop will be hosted on **25 October 2024** by the University of Amsterdam.

Alice and Eve event is inspired by the [BCS Lovelace Colloquium](https://bcswomenlovelace.bcs.org/) that started in 2008. For more details about earlier editions of Alice & Eve, see the websites of [2020](https://fmt.ewi.utwente.nl/events/aliceandeve2020/), [2021](https://aliceandeve.cs.ru.nl/), [2022](https://alice-and-eve.github.io/2022/) and [2023](https://alice-and-eve.github.io/2023/).

The event is held during a single day, and features:

- keynote talks,
- a poster contest, and
- an exhibition on women in computing.

Join us, and participate to our poster contest on the topic of your choice!

### Date:

Alice & Eve will take place on October 25th, 2024.

## Poster Contest

Details regarding the poster contest will update soon.
<!--We invited all female students (Bachelor/Master/PhD) and early career researchers of computing and related subjects (in the broadest sense) to submit a poster. The poster could be on any computing topic they like: from social networking to quantum computing and from medical image processing to formal verification. Twenty-five posters were short listed for display during the event, where the following winners were chosen:

**Winner: Shruti Rao**

Towards Emotionally Intelligent Spaces: Enhancing Human Well-being and Experiences in Smart Buildings

**Runner-up: Isabella Venancia Gardner**

Machine Learning for Electrostatic Ground-State Simulation of Silicon Dangling Bond Logic: Exploring the Impact of Custom Physical Feature Encodings in Transformer-based Models

Congratulations Shruti and Isabella! We would like to thank Versen for sponsoring the contest and our programme committee (Marco Brohet, Christopher Esterhuyse, Stefan Schlobach, Lise Stork, Krisztina Szilagyi, Monika Trimoska, Romy Vos and Shuai Wang) for their hard work behind the scenes.-->

## Exhibition

Details regarding the exhibition will update soon.
<!-- In addition to the keynote talks and the posters, there will be an exhibition which portrays thirty women in computing
and their most important contributions.

Some highlights of the exhibition:

- **Grace Hopper** who created the world’s first workable compiler;
- **Ada Lovelace** who is known for her work on the design of the ‘Analytics Machine’, the first ever general-purpose
  computer, and the first published algorithm;
- **Rosalind Picard** and her work on Affective Computing which is a combination of Computer Science, Psychology,
  Physiology and Cognitive Sciences;
- **Frances Brazier** who helped establish the first Internet Service Provider (ISP) in the Netherlands and Europe.

More information on these women, and many others, can be found at the exhibition and
the [online booklet](https://fmt.ewi.utwente.nl/events/aliceandeve2020/booklet-13-01-2020.pdf).-->

## Speakers

Details regarding the timeline will update soon.
<!-- We have invited some inspiring women working on the cutting edge of computing. Confirmed speakers include:

- **Rianne van den Berg** - I am a Principal Researcher at Microsoft Research Amsterdam, where I work on the intersection of deep learning and computational chemistry and physics for molecular simulation. My research has spanned a range of topics from generative modeling, variational inference, source compression, graph-structured learning to condensed matter physics. Before joining MSR I was a Research Scientist at Google Brain. I received my PhD in theoretical condensed-matter physics in 2016 at the University of Amsterdam, where I also worked as a postdoctoral researcher as part of the Amsterdam Machine Learning Lab (AMLAB). In 2019 I won the Faculty of Science Lecturer of the Year award at the University of Amsterdam for teaching a machine learning course in the master of AI ([website](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/rvandenberg/)).
- **Marieke van Erp** - Marieke van Erp is a Language Technology and Semantic Web expert engaged in interdisciplinary research. She holds a PhD in computational linguistics from Tilburg University and has worked on many (inter)national interdisciplinary projects such as the FP7 NewsReader project, CLARIAH, and the H2020 Odeuropa project. Since 2017, she has been leading the Digital Humanities Research Lab at the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences Humanities Cluster. She is one of the founders and scientific directors of the Cultural AI Lab, a collaboration between 8 research and cultural heritage institutions in the Netherlands aimed at the study, design and development of socio-technological AI systems that are aware of the subtle and subjective complexity of human culture. In January 2024, she was awarded an ERC Consolidator project that will investigate how language and semantic web technologies can improve the creation of knowledge graphs supporting humanities research.
- **Carla Groenland** - After doing bachelor's and master's degrees in both mathematics and artificial intelligence, Carla obtained a mathematics PhD at the University of Oxford and then did a postdoc at the Algorithms group of Utrecht University. She is now an assistant professor at TU Delft, performing research both on abstract properties of networks (and other discrete structures) as well as on how these can be exploited to yield efficient algorithms ([website](https://cgroenland.wordpress.com/)). 
- **Ana Oprescu** - Ana Oprescu is an Assistant Professor in the Complex CyberInfrastructure research group in the Institute of Informatics (IvI) at the University of Amsterdam since 2021. Previously she was a lecturer in the Parallel Computing Systems research group in the same institute. She is the Program Director of the Software Engineering Master, as well as a member of the Women in the Faculty of Science (WiF) board. Together with Paola Grosso and Judith Good, she piloted the Nanny Fund initiative. She received her Senior Teaching Qualification in 2020. Her research goal is to understand the fundamental laws governing the complexity of modern software services such that we can eventually build controllable complex software services. She is currently exploring this interplay in the context of a Responsible Digital Transformation Seed grant on the energy cost of privacy-enhancing techniques and a Stimulation grant on the opportunities to simultaneously optimize energy cost, explainability, and accuracy of ML. Obviously, she secretly thinks everything is a Pareto front.
- **Marcela Tuler de Oliveira** - Assistant Professor in Trustworthy Data Systems at Delft University of Technology, Department of Engineering Systems & Services, Dr. ir. Marcela Tuler de Oliveira stands out as a Telecommunications Engineer shaping the future of cross-organizational data sharing. Her expertise lies in leveraging Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) for secure, traceable, and accountable data platforms, with impactful solutions spanning sectors like healthcare, aviation, and smart cities. As the task leader for the H2022 EU ExtremeXP project (2024-26), she's driving innovations in data management and access control using DLT. Besides her research, she’s a passionate educator at TU Delft, teaching and mentoring the next wave of tech innovators [website](https://www.tudelft.nl/staff/m.tulerdeoliveira/?cHash=ccdf4dc5f4015e6210a4fd157778321b) [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcelatuler/).-->
